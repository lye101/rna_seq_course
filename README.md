# RNA Sequencing Workflow

**Obtain Data**

**Read Quality Checks**
- FastQC and MultiQC : scripts 1 and 2

**Mapping reads onto reference genome**
- Download reference genome : script 3
- Indexing files : script 4
- Map onto reference genome and read quality check : script 5 and 5.5
- BAM sorting and indexing : script 6

**Feature counts**
- Obtain count data for each gene : script 7

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Quantify Differentially Expressed Genes and visualize withvolcano plot
- Gene Ontology overrepresentation analysis and visualize with dotplots
- Specefic Gene Analysis with boxplots
